    "subject": "Re: LNG May 19 decisio",
    "original_content": "John,\n\nThis is the update on what I have done for the LNG transactions.\n\n1. I was not involved in the LNG ship project. I shall  read the DASH \nand give you my comments. Without looking at the details, I think that the \ndecision\nto charter a tanker removes one significant risk we have at the Elba Island \nproject (please, see point 2).\n\n2. Elba Island. I am working with Doug Rotenberbg, Brad Hitch, Scott Earnest \n(Sally Beck's organization) and RAC to set up the book for the Elba Island \ntransaction. The next step\nwill be to expand the book to capture all the Enron's LNG-related  positions  \nin one place and\nto look for natural risk offsets and possible hedges. A working group is \nmeeting to close a few\nremaining gaps  tomorrow (Tuesday) at 8:30.\n\nA few comments on the book design and my view of the project:\n\na. The current thinking is that LNG will be sourced for the Elba Island \nfacility\nby buying marginal cargos on the fob basis. Marginal cargos will represent\nsupply from excess capacity that has not been committed under long-term\ncontracts or became available due to some short-term frictions.\n\nThe fob cargos are typically selling at a significant discount to the \nlong-term\ncontract prices. The economics of the deal, as represented by the book we are \nsetting up, will reflect the assumption that not only we can locate marginal \ncargos\nbut that we shall be able to do it on a regular basis, arranging shipping and \ncoordinating\nthe facility schedule and natural gas transactions in the US. In other words,\nwe have a significant logistical and operational risk in this transaction.\n\nb. The transaction will cover the period of 17 years (with an extension \noption of\n5 years). Even if we can lock-in the LNG volumes over this time period, we\nhave no ability to lock-in the other side of the spread (US gas prices) for \nsuch a long tenor. This is  \nessentially a tolling transaction with exposure to the LNG - nat gas spread \nand\nI would not recommend locking-in only one leg of the spread.\n\nOne solution would be to  cover, let's say, 50% of he LNG volumes for the \nfirst\n5 years and lock-in the nat gas side on the US market side.\n\nc. The book we are setting up will be based on many managerial assumptions\nregarding sources of LNG, shipping rates, schedules, etc. I would set up a \nbig prudence reserve\nin case we mark it to market.\n\nd. My group will work on valuation of some options we have in the Elba Island \ndeal\n(that are good for Enron) and on the hedging strategy for the LNG positions.\nLong-term LNG contracts are typically based on the Japanese Crude Cocktail \nthat \ncorrelates very well with Brent.\n\n\nVince\n\n\n\n\nJohn Sherriff\n05/14/2000 01:40 AM\nTo: Vince J Kaminski/HOU/ECT@ECT\ncc: Lauren Urquhart/LON/ECT@ECT \nSubject: LNG May 19 decision\n\n\nVince\n\nI haven't spoken to you for awhile but hope the world is treating you well.  \nAnyway with Greg moving to his\nnew role I have (I hope only temporarily) staff trading oversight for the \nEastern Hemishere plus LNG.\n\nI understand that your group is taking a first cut at developing curves for \nLNG and LNG ship values.   I also understand\nthat another LNG ship decision is on the dockets for May 19 (not very far \naway).  Anway I understand this\nis a big decision but I still have gotten very little info yet.  Can you \nplease let me know where you stand now?\n\nI will ask my assistant Lauren to set up a time that I can speak with you in \nthe next couple of days and if you\nhave anything for me to review before then she can get it faxed to me as well.\n\nLook forward to connecting with you Vince.\n\nJohn\n\n",
