Ideally I think we should establish a number of topic \nareas  around which the moderator can lead the discussion - naturally for the \nbetter  discussions it's important to have varying views on similar subjects; \nsimilarly  it is often interesting to hear the panel's comments on one \nindividual's more  specific area of knowledge.\n?\nConseqently if you could return this email (to all panel  members) with \ntopics you feel should be covered, any particular areas you would  personally \nlike to focus on, any proposed changes to the actual panel structure,  and \npossibly additonal panel members you think should be there, that would be a  \ngood start. I am still in the process of looking for a moderator and if \nanyone  has any suggestions, please let me know.\n?\n(The talk title is Effectively Applying Weather  Derivatives)\n?\nBest regards,\n?\nOliver?\n?\n?\nDirect: +44 (0)20 7484  9880\n?\nRisk Publications, 28-29 Haymarket,  London SW1Y 4RX\nFax: +44 (0)20 7484 9800?
