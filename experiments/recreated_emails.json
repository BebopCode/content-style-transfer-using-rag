    "original_content": "X-Origin: Kaminski-VX-FileName: vkamins.nsfChonawee,As I have pointed out, short-selling the stock may be a bad decision because of tax implications (ignoring the legal aspects).Suppose the strike is $70 and you were granted an ATM option.You  sell short at $70 ten lots (one lot  = 100 shares). The price goes to $100.  You lose $30 x 1000 = $30,000 on your short position. Option exercise gives you $30,000. This is before taxes. You pay taxeson your option income (it's treated as ordinary income). The tax is28% x $30,000 = $8,400. You can use only $3,000 of your loss againstordinary income. This saves you only $840 in taxes. Of course, if you have capital gains, you can use losses on your option positionas an offset.The remaining part of your capital loss  is carried forward and you get thetax benefits over time (less the time value of money), assuming you have income in thefuture (or capital gains).Not so good.By the way, valuation and optimal exercise of employee stock optionsis a very interesting and difficult problem.VinceChonawee Supatgiat@ENRON07/10/2000 11:40 AMTo: Stinson Gibner/HOU/ECT@ECT, Vince J Kaminski/HOU/ECT@ECTcc:  Subject: short-sell vs exerciseBelow is my writing that was originally planned to post somewhere. It explains how to handle a special type of call options which can be exercised but cannot be sold. (As we know that it is never optimal to exercise a call option before its maturity). However, after taking Vince's comments on the ordinary income/capital loss TAX offsetting issue, I think this is not a good article anymore. I guess I could just throw this article away. :-)-chonaweeShort-selling is better than exercising your employee stock optionsIn general, the sensible time to exercise your employee stock option is when you speculate that ENE is going down or its growth rate is extremely low. In fact, when exercising the options, you are speculating that ENE would never reach this point (plus interest) again during the 10 years maturity date or until you leave the company. If you do not anticipate that, you should hold on to your options because you can gain higher profit by delaying your exercise.However, if you believe that ENE is reaching its peak. Then, instead of exercising the options, you should short-sell (or sell) the stocks in that amount. After short-selling, when you feel that the stock starts to go up, you can buy them back (to cover), make profit, and still keep the options. On the other hand, if the stock does not go down as expect, you can exercise the options to cover your short position anytime. Let us take a look at a simple case where there are no taxes, no dividends, and zero risk-free rate. Suppose that ENE follows a simple sample path as followIf you exercise 100 ENE options with a grant price of 45 when ENE reaches 70, you would earn  (70-45)*100 = $2,500. But if you short sell 100 ENE at 70, no matter how much ENE is in the future, you can exercise the options to cover the short position and still earn (70-45)*100 = $2,500. The advantage of short-selling comes when ENE at the period 2 is 60. At this point, you can cover your short position, get (70-60)*100 = $1,000, and still keep your options or you can exercise the options and gain $2,500. That is, you still keep the flexibility of your options when you short-sell. In conclusion, the only sensible time to exercise your employee stock options is to cover your short position.",

I wanted to follow up on our recent discussion regarding the potential short-selling of ATM options (e.g., at $70) before exercise.\n\nAfter reviewing the tax implications, it appears that the short-selling strategy may not be as tax-efficient as initially anticipated. While the losses could offset up to $840, the high tax burden on any gains could significantly dilute the net benefit. This complicates the overall valuation of the options, making the strategy less optimal from a financial perspective.\n\nCould we revisit this approach to ensure we\u2019re aligning with the most tax-effective and profitable path forward? Let me know a convenient time to discuss further\u2014I\u2019m happy to share additional insights or explore alternatives.\n\nLooking forward to your thoughts.\n\n**Best regards,**\nVince Kaminski\n*vince.kaminski@enron.com*",

The math suggests that while you\u2019d offset $840 in losses, the tax hit on gains could easily outweigh that benefit. It\u2019s worth weighing whether the short-selling approach is still the most tax-efficient path, given how it complicates the valuation picture.\n\nAt the end of the day, I\u2019m happy to hear your perspective\u2014whether you agree or not. The goal is to make sure we\u2019re not leaving money (or tax liabilities) on the table. And as always, I\u2019m here if you\u2019d like to run through the numbers together.\n\n**Vince**\n\n---\n**Key notes on style/tone alignment:**\n1. **Direct but collaborative** \u2013 No ultimatums, but a clear point of view framed as a shared problem to solve.\n2. **\"I\u2019m happy to hear your perspective\"** \u2013 Mirrors Vince\u2019s encouragement of debate (e.g., *\"I expect and encourage disagreement\"* in prior emails).\n3. **Open-ended closing** \u2013 Invites dialogue without pressure, consistent with his *\"facts are friendly\"* ethos.\n4. **Minimal jargon** \u2013 Keeps it practical (e.g., *\"tax hit on gains\"* instead of dense technical language).\n5. **No over-apology** \u2013 Unlike Chonawee\u2019s *\"Sorry\"* emails, Vince\u2019s tone is matter-of-fact but warm."
